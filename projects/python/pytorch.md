- Background: PyTorch is an open source machine learning framework that accelerates the path from research prototyping to production deployment.

- Rationale: I use PyTorch for my research project. As it currently has 5K+ issues, I've selected it as a project that I will contribute to.

PyTorch is a Python package that provides two high-level features:

- Tensor computation (like NumPy) with strong GPU acceleration
- Deep neural networks built on a tape-based autograd system


Usually, PyTorch is used either as:

- A replacement for NumPy to use the power of GPUs.
- A deep learning research platform that provides maximum flexibility and speed.
